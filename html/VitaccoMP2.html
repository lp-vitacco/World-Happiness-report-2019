					<h1> The 2019 World Happiness Report </h1>
					<h2> Finland </h2>
				</div>
				<div id="left" class= "introduction">
					<p> The information discussed on this page can be found on the <a href="www.worldhappiness.report/ed/2019/">World Happiness Report Website</a>. The data was downloaded from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness?select=2018.csv"> Kaggle</a>. </p>
					<section id="introduction">
						<p> The World Happiness Report is a collection of data from Gallup World Poll published by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network. The data collected is used to analyze the happiness levels of nations across the world over the years. This study focuses on the 2019 World Happiness Report with a focus on Finland, which was rated the number one happiest country of the year.</p>
						
						<p>The data that will be analyzed is based off on a survey conducted by the Gallup World Poll group. The survey was structured using the Cantril life ladder method. The participants were asked to think of the responses like a ladder, with 10 being the top or best and 0 being the bottom or worst. With this survey and other background information, the researchers created a countries overall Happiness Score. After determining this they conducted further investigation on what factors might impact the scores the most. The factors they judged each country on was: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. They determined what was the level of influence was for each factor in each country. The numbers I work with in the dataset reflect how the researchers thought that factor influenced the overall happiness score. </p>

						<p>I decided to focus on Finland because I am interested to see how the six factors influenced the highest ranking country. I want to if other top countries are influenced similarly.</p>

					<ul id= "Vairable-list"> 
						<li> Overall Rank </li>

						<li> Score </li>
							<p id = "explanation">The average happiness score taken from the Gallop surveys. </p>
						<li> GDP Per Capita </li>
							<p id = "explanation"> The extent to which GDP per capita impacted the happiness scores. GDP per capital was from the World Development Indicators update of November 14, 2018. </p>
						<li> Social Support </li>
							<p id = "explanation"> The extent to which social support impacted the happiness scores. Social support was based on a survey question asking is the person felt supported in their life. </p>
						<li> Healthy Life Expectancy </li>
							<p id = "explanation"> The extent to which healhty life expectancy impacted the happiness scores. Life expectancy data was from the World Health Organization data repository. </p>
						<li> Freedom to Make Life Choices </li>
							<p id = "explanation"> The extent to which freedom impacted the happiness scores. Freedom was based on a survey question asking about the person's satisfaction in their freedom of choice. </p>
						<li> Generosity </li>
							<p id = "explanation">The extent to which generosity impacted the happiness scores. Generosity was based on a survey question asking whether or not a person donated to charity, which helped to see the generorsity of the public.</p>

						<h2> Top Five Happiest Countries' GDP </h2>
							<p> In the following graph, I looked at the top five happiest countries in comparison to their GDP.Again, the GDP variable is not the actual GDP per capita of the countries; it is the extent to which it affects the happiness score relative to the other factors as well. Finland's happiness score is not very impacted by the GDP per capita in the country. I wanted to see if the other happiest countries were similar.   </p1>

				</div>
				<div id="right2">
					<p id="graph1-text"> As you can see in the graph, the happiness score and the GDP per capita influence has no correlation to one another. All five countries are disperesed throughout the graph. Something to look further into would be the actual GDP per capitas for each of these countries. </p>

				<div id= "left3">

				<h2> Each Factor of Specific Countries </h2>
					<p> For the next section, I looked at the countries that have the highest scores in each of the six factors including Finland, the top ranked country. This will also let me compare the factors to each other to see if there are any trends in the influences of factors. Below is the list of factors with the top country and their overall rank. </p>
						<ul>  
							<li> Score: Finland <i>1st</i></li>
							<li> GDP Per Capita: Qatar <i>39th</i> </li>
							<li> Social Support: Iceland <i>4th</i> </li>
							<li> Healthy Life Expectancy: Singapore <i>34th</i></li>
							<li> Freedom: Uzbekistan <i>41st</i></li>
							<li> Generosity: Myanmar <i>131st</i></li>
							<li> Corruption: Singapore <i>39th</i></li>

				<div id= "left5">
					<p> The relationship between overall rank of a country and a specific category is interesting to compare. Finland is overall the happiest country and is not the highest in any of the factors. Does this allude to balance being the key to happiness? The majority of the countries chosen are in the middle of the ranking, which helps support the idea that certain factors of a nation's happiness should not be placed all in one area (or factor) of life. 

					Something else I noticed was how the GDP and Social Support factors overall influenced the countries happiness scales more so than the other factors.

            <h2> Perceptions of Corruption </h2>
                <p>For my last visualization I wanted to look at the how often corruption was thought to impact the countries, and whether that had an impact on the data. </p> 
                    <div class= "corruption">
                    <img src= "./images/Frequency1.png" width= "500"> 
                    </div>
            </div>    
			<div id= "right6">
				<p> Finland has been influenced more by corruption in the government than the majority of other countries. By looking at this and the previous information we see how it is more common for the perception of corruption to be an unimportant factor compated to others. Iceland has a much lower corruption score as well and would be closer to the average of the perception of corruption. It is hard to say there is a clear trend from the data displayed here. The level of impact corrpution has on a nation varies regardless of its rank. </p>
			</div>
			<div id= "left7">
				<p>From the analysis it is hard to draw a lot of conclusions about the dataset and the factors' influence on the happiness scores as a whole. From the results of the first graph there seems to be no correlation between the GDP factor and the higher ranked countries. However, in the second section we can see that GDP and social support are more influencial on the happiness scores of the countries than the generorsity or perception of corruption factors. In order to make a conclusive statement about this trend, I would want to take a random sample of the countries to see if this trend is consistent throughout the overall population.</p>

				<p> Finland more consistently shows even scores throughout the six factors, which leads me to believe that this could be a factor in their high happiness score. There are still many other factors and information needed to make a definative statement or conclusion. </p>
