# World Happiness Report: Finland (2019)

## Northeastern University Graduate Class Project 
### ARTG:5330 Visualization Technologies 1 

Visualization technologies 1 focused on skills necessary for engineering visualization using code. This course focused on R and D3.js. R allowed students to analyze, transform, and clean data, while D3.js created data-driven visualization for the web. The class first focused on understanding data, so you could create interesting graphs and analyses later on in the semester. Other languages such as, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, were used when designing the graphs and information in an online format. 

The course had three mini projects throughout the semester, which featured visualizations based on topics from class. The code displayed here is from mini project 2. 

#### Mini Project 2 

This project was a revision of the first mini project based off of professor and peer feedback. Mini project 1 required:

* At least three visualizations created using ggplot2 in R. 
* An HTML file with 3 different sections in its structure. All had to have a clear header with text and one visualization. 
* The page had to have a narrative that explained the data and the visualizations. 

Mini project 2 required an additional 10 HTML elements and 20 CSS rules. It also required we consider and change the projects based off of feedback. 

#### My Mini Project 2

For my first mini project my biggest flaw was my narrative of the data. It was too vague because I focused on the whole dataset. In my second project I narrowed in on Finland and compared it to other countries in the data. The data displays various calculations of a country's happiness. I chose to focus on Finland because it had the highest happiness score. 

The texts and graphs created were structured as a grid in my HTML, which allowed me to easily organize the content. I created 25 CSS rules and 80 HTML elements in my final product.
